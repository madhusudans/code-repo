1. The program - viterbi.py has the model described in Figure 6.3 from the textbook hard-coded into it.

2. The program can be run as follows:

	Example1:	python viterbi.py "[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]"

	Example 1: 	python viterbi.py "[1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]"

	Example 3:	python viterbi.py "[3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2]"

   Note: The input array [] must be given in quotes ("") as it is handled as a string in the system arguments in the program.
